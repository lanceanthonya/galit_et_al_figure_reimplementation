# galit_et_al_figure_reimplementation
Cin Aquino's contribution to a project submitted in Winter Quarter 2023 
as part of a final project for Dr. Aaron Meyer's Bioengineering 175 course at UCLA. 
Presentation was cleaned up and text added to help with interpretability of results.
(Project collaborators who worked on other figures: Susanna Ferrier, Leon Wu, and Lauren Hunter) 

Code presented was used for recreating figures 2A, 2D, 3A,
and 3B from (Galit et al 2018): https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20177881

Also includes the cross validation and implementation of a 4-class
random forest classifier to compare its performance with a multinomial 
4-class Logistic Regression model
